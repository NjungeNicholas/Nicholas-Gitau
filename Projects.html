        <h2>Productivity</h2>
        <p>Over the past two years, I have developed a keen interest in productivity. I have learned a lot from influencers like <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal" target="_blank" > Ali Abdaal</a>, a vlogger and entrepreneur, about the importance of productivity. 
        Techniques such as the Trident Method, Second Brain, and using tools like <a href= "https://www.notion.com/" target="_blank">Notion</a> have significantly enhanced my daily activities.</p>
